# AWS IAM Setup: Raju User & DevOps Configuration

This repo documents the steps and commands used to set up an IAM user (`Raju`), secure access with MFA, group permissions, and SSM access for EC2 in private subnets.

---

## ✅ Overview of What Was Done

### 1. Create IAM user `Raju`
- Created a new IAM user with console access.
- Set an initial password for login.

### 2. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for `Raju`
- Attached a virtual MFA device (e.g., Google Authenticator).
- Enforced MFA login to enhance security.

### 3. Create group `Devops` with Administrator Access
- Created group `Devops`.
- Attached `AdministratorAccess` managed policy to `Devops` group to provide full AWS access.

### 4. Add `Raju` to `Devops`
- Added the `Raju` user as a member of the `Devops` group (inherits admin permissions).

### 5. Login as `Raju`
- Logged in via AWS Console using:
  - **Username**: Raju  
  - **Password**: *(initial console password)*  
  - **MFA code**: generated by authenticator  
- Verified resulting permissions (all admin actions permitted).

### 6. Create IAM Role for SSM Access
- Created `SSMAccessForPrivateEC2` role.
  - Trusted entity: `ec2.amazonaws.com`
  - Added `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore` policy for SSM functionality :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.
- Attached this role as an **instance profile** to EC2 instances in private subnets enabling Sessions Manager (no SSH ports required).
